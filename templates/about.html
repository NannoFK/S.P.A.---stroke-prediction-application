          Application model was trained on data provided by McKinsey - an American management consulting firm. 
          Over the last few years, a chain of hospitals in the United States aiming to create the next 
          generation of healthcare for its patients has captured several health, demographic and lifestyle 
          details about its patients. This data includes such details as age and gender, along with several 
          health parameters (e.g. hypertension, body mass index) and lifestyle related variables (e.g. smoking 
          status, occupation type). There are records about more that 43 000 patients with 12 features, 
          including the target feature called ‘stroke’.

          During the project our team faced with binary classification problem. This is the task of classifying 
          the elements of a data set into two groups on the basis of a specific classification rule.  
          Given medical data requires a decision whether or not a person has some specified characteristic to 
          be recognized as ill (does not have stroke) or healthy (has a stroke) and give customers information 
          about probability of stroke they have.

          eXtreme Gradient Boosting was chosen as the most suitable model for this task. XGBoost is a 
          decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. 
          It has a  wide range of applications, portable, supports all major programming languages and 
          integrate with different ecosystems.
